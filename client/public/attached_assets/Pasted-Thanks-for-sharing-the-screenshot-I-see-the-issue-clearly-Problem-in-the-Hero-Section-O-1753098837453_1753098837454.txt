Thanks for sharing the screenshot — I see the issue clearly.

### 🧾 Problem in the Hero Section:

On your 16" MacBook Pro (and likely on other wide screens):

* The **"pc" logotype** and **navigation** are pushed into odd positions.
* The **tagline** (“Where Mood meets Momentum”) and **subheadline** are slightly misaligned.
* The **PITCHCRAFT** text overlaps the motorbike and the astronaut in a way that feels unbalanced, possibly due to absolute positioning or scaling not adjusting proportionally.

### ✅ Suggested Fix Prompt for Replit (to correct all breakpoints):

> 🔧 **Prompt to fix Hero Section sizing and layout across all breakpoints:**
>
> * Please revise the **Hero section layout** so it remains balanced and correctly scaled across **all screen widths** — from 320px wide phones to 2560px+ ultra-wide monitors, including 16" MacBooks.
>
> * The issues I’m seeing:
>
>   * The **logo (pc)** and **tagline** are oversized and misaligned on large screens.
>   * The **PITCHCRAFT** title scales too large and overlaps foreground elements.
>   * Layout and positioning are not consistent across breakpoints.
>
> * I need:
>
>   1. **Container widths** and padding to be percentage-based or max-width limited (`max-width: 1440px; margin: 0 auto`) so text and logos don’t stretch out on large screens.
>   2. **Text sizes** to be responsive using `clamp()` or `calc()` to scale smoothly but avoid oversizing:
>
>      ```css
>      font-size: clamp(2rem, 5vw, 6rem);
>      ```
>   3. **Media queries** to control layout at:
>
>      * `max-width: 480px` – phones
>      * `481px–768px` – tablets
>      * `769px–1024px` – laptops
>      * `1025px–1440px` – desktops
>      * `1441px–1920px+` – large screens
>   4. Ensure all **elements scale proportionally** and remain centered/aligned at each size.
>
> * Bonus: If using Framer Motion or GSAP, ensure animations don’t cause jumpy scaling at different breakpoints.
>
> Please apply this to **all elements in the Hero section**, not just desktop.

Let me know if you'd like the exact CSS rules or if you want me to help you draft a Framer-compatible adjustment instead.
