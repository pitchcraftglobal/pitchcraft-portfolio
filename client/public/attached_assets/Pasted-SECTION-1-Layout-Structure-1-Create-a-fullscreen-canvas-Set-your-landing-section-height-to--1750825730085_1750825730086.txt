SECTION 1: Layout & Structure
🟦 1. Create a fullscreen canvas:

Set your landing section height to 100vh (100% of viewport height).

Ensure no scrollbars are visible on load.

Use a flex container to center the content both vertically and horizontally.

🟪 2. Apply a layered visual background:

Insert a portrait image (preferably side profile) as a full-screen background.

The image should have:

Heavy blur or double exposure styling

A mix of red, blue, and purple color overlays

Slight opacity and motion blur effect, mimicking long-exposure photography

🟫 3. Add a transparent grain overlay texture:

Overlay a subtle grain pattern across the entire screen.

It should be barely visible but give a tactile, film-like quality.

Use PNG or CSS texture pattern (e.g. from TransparentTextures.com).

✳️ SECTION 2: Typography & Layout Composition
🟧 4. Main Headline — split and bold:

Use ultra-bold sans-serif font (e.g. Space Grotesk, Suisse Int'l, or Neue Montreal)

Line 1: “Digital” — left aligned or center

Line 2: “Design Studio” — stacked below with matching font weight

🟨 5. Apply dynamic color fill to text:

Add a gradient fill (e.g. yellow → turquoise → orange) to the headline text.

This should not be a solid color — the gradient should move slightly on scroll or hover if possible.

The result should feel like colorful lighting painted across the typography.

🟩 6. Supporting Text Elements:

Place a small paragraph in bottom-left corner with 2–3 lines describing the value proposition:

e.g. “We create digital designs that help brands move faster and convert better.”

Set in small white text, thin font weight, max 3 lines

Place a small block of 4 service tags on the right-hand side, vertically stacked (e.g. UX/UI, Development)

These should be white, unembellished, and calm — to balance the bold headline

✳️ SECTION 3: UI Elements & Navigation
🟦 7. Top Navigation Bar (Fixed):

Align the following across the top of the screen:

Top-left: “LYNIQ” logo (replace with “PITCHCRAFT”) in all caps

Center: Page links (e.g. “ABOUT”, “PROJECTS”, “CONTACT”) — spaced evenly, small, white text

Top-right: “MENU” in uppercase, bold font — aligned flush right

🟩 8. Mid-header data tag (optional):

Place a turquoise number in brackets in the center-top navigation, e.g. (17)

This indicates number of projects and adds personality to the header

Use a contrasting neon/turquoise color for pop

✳️ SECTION 4: Transitions & Animations
🟫 9. Page Load Entrance:

Fade in the entire background image on load with a slight delay (0.5s–1s)

Animate headline and subtext to slide upward slightly as they appear

Side service tags and paragraph text can fade in with staggered delay

🟧 10. Typography motion:

Subtle parallax or scale animation on scroll or mouse movement (optional)

Hover states on menu text can use opacity or underline animations

✳️ SECTION 5: Responsive Design
📱 11. Mobile Responsiveness:

Stack “Digital” and “Design Studio” vertically, center-aligned

Reduce font sizes proportionally

Move supporting paragraph to below the text block

Convert top nav into a hamburger menu for small screens
