Objective
Design a sleek, fully responsive website for Pitchcraft — a Mumbai-based visual design studio — with the visual sophistication and modern interactivity of the “Bronx Dark Portfolio” site.

1. Overall Feel
Dark theme with cinematic edge

Bold typography with clean spacing

Smooth transitions and hover effects

Responsive layout for desktop, tablet, and mobile

Scroll-based animations or fade-ins for content blocks

2. Hero Section
Studio name spaced out: p i t c hc r a f t

Minimalist intro with fade-up animation:

“PITCHCRAFT is a bespoke visual design studio established in Mumbai, India, where creating bold and cinematic pitch decks and mood boards tailored for commercials, documentaries, and films is the norm.”

Tagline below with center-aligned stacked lines:

VISUALLY LOADED DECKS.  
DESIGNED TO PITCH.  
PRIMED TO WIN.
3. About Section
Smooth fade or slide-in text blocks:

“Elevated by a collective experience of over 2 decades, our team combines a global perspective with a passion for visual storytelling. We pride ourselves on delivering high-impact designs that resonate with clients worldwide.”

Layout similar to Bronx with one side showing text, the other showing motion visuals or parallax media

4. Studio Info Section
Bold monochrome text cards:

5. Services Section
Use Bronx-style cards or floating labels with hover animations:

visual research

layout design

AI image generation

6. Clients Section
Use a horizontal scroll or animated grid of logos under the heading:
BRANDS WE’VE WORKED WITH

Keep branding minimal but sophisticated

7. Portfolio Section
Grid or masonry layout of projects (at least 24)

Each thumbnail should animate slightly on hover

A lightbox/modal opens on click to view more

Add a subtle “view our full portfolio” link at the bottom

8. Navigation & Footer
Sticky top navigation with simple scroll anchors

Footer should match the Bronx style: minimal, with centered or left-aligned contact info and studio location

9. Responsive Design Goals
Desktop: Grid-based layout, immersive visuals

Tablet: Reflow content for vertical readability

Mobile: Stack sections, optimize font and touch targets

Ensure all animations and hover states degrade gracefully

10. Design Direction
Dark mode aesthetic

Cinematic, high-impact visuals

Smooth parallax or fade-ins

Sharp contrast in type hierarchy

No clutter — every section should feel intentional
