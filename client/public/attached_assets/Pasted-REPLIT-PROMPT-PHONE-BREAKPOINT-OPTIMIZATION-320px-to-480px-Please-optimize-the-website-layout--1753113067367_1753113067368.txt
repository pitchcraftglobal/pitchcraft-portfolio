ðŸ”§ THINGS TO FIX (PHONE ONLY)

1. HERO SECTION
	â€¢	Ensure headline, subheadline, and CTA button are fully visible and donâ€™t overflow.
	â€¢	Prevent horizontal scrolling.
	â€¢	Keep supporting text from overlapping with images or background.

2. TEXT & TYPE
	â€¢	Set minimum font size to 16px for body text.
	â€¢	Maintain proper line-height (e.g., 1.4â€“1.6) for readability on small screens.

3. BUTTONS & TAP TARGETS
	â€¢	All interactive elements (buttons, links, icons) must have a minimum tap area of 44x44px.
	â€¢	Add spacing between tappable elements to avoid mis-taps.

4. IMAGES & LAYOUT
	â€¢	Images should use max-width: 100% and keep correct aspect ratio.
	â€¢	Avoid image distortion or cropping on narrow screens.
	â€¢	Prevent layout shifts by defining width and height attributes or using object-fit.

5. NAVIGATION MENU
	â€¢	Hamburger icon should not be flush with the screen edge â€” add at least 16px padding.
	â€¢	Ensure mobile menu overlay displays instantly and without misalignment.

6. ANIMATIONS (Phone Only)
	â€¢	Minimize large or CPU-heavy animations.
	â€¢	Ensure all animations (fade-ins, sliding text, etc.) run smoothly at 60fps.
	â€¢	Avoid scroll-based parallax or hover effects that donâ€™t work well on mobile.
	â€¢	Use prefers-reduced-motion media query where needed.

7. VIEWPORT
	â€¢	Confirm the following meta tag is present in <head>:

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

8. ACCESSIBILITY
	â€¢	Add alt text to all non-decorative images.
	â€¢	Ensure visible focus indicators for all interactive elements (buttons, links).
