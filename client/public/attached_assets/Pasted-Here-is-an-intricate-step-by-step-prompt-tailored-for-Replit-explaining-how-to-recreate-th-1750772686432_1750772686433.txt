Here is an **intricate, step-by-step prompt** tailored for **Replit**, explaining how to recreate the **visual effects and transitions in the hero section** of the [Lyniq website](https://lyniq.framer.website/) as it loads:

## üéØ Replit-Compatible Prompt:

**Build a Floating, Cinematic Hero Section Inspired by Lyniq‚Äôs Landing Page**

---

### üß© Objective

Create a visually immersive hero section that opens with a smooth fade-in and scale animation of a central object (or image), includes continuous floating motion, and integrates soft scroll-triggered parallax effects‚Äîall emulating the Lyniq website's polished behavior.

---

## üîß Step-by-Step Instructions

---

### 1. **Set Up the Hero Layout**

* Create a full-screen hero section:

  * Use `height: 100vh` and `width: 100%`
  * Background: dark or black (`#0d0d0d` recommended)
  * Center the content both vertically and horizontally using Flexbox or Grid.

* Add two main layers inside:

  * **Foreground text layer** (headline + CTA)
  * **Central visual object** (image, SVG, or canvas-based 3D asset)

---

### 2. **Fade + Scale In On Page Load**

* Apply an **entry animation** to both the central object and text:

```css
@keyframes fadeScaleIn {
  0% {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: scale(0.95) translateY(20px);
  }
  100% {
    opacity: 1;
    transform: scale(1) translateY(0);
  }
}
```

* Add this animation to the hero content on load:

  * Duration: `1s`
  * Easing: `ease-out`
  * Delay: text slightly after the visual for a staggered feel

---

### 3. **Floating Motion on Central Visual**

* Add a **looping keyframe animation** to the visual object that simulates floating:

```css
@keyframes float {
  0%   { transform: translateY(0px); }
  50%  { transform: translateY(-12px); }
  100% { transform: translateY(0px); }
}
```

* Apply it with:

  * `animation: float 5s ease-in-out infinite;`
  * Optional: Add slight `rotateZ` or `rotateX` for added dimension

---

### 4. **Scroll-Responsive Parallax Shift**

* As the user scrolls down:

  * The hero visual should **translate upward slightly slower** than the scroll to create parallax depth.
  * Use JavaScript `window.scrollY` to adjust transform on scroll:

```js
window.addEventListener('scroll', () => {
  const scrollOffset = window.scrollY;
  document.querySelector('.hero-object').style.transform = 
    `translateY(${scrollOffset * 0.2}px)`;
});
```

* This keeps the object feeling ‚Äúanchored‚Äù in 3D space as the rest of the page moves.

---

### 5. **Text Layer Remains Focused Longer**

* The foreground text (e.g., headline/CTA) should:

  * Remain fixed or move slower on scroll to hold attention.
  * Optionally use `position: sticky` for short duration before releasing

```css
.hero-text {
  position: sticky;
  top: 20vh;
}
```

---

### 6. **Refinement and Responsiveness**

* Add smooth transition properties (`transition: all 0.3s ease-out;`) to hover or focus elements.
* Ensure all effects degrade gracefully on smaller screens:

  * Reduce floating animation distance
  * Limit parallax or make it optional with media queries

---

### ‚ú® Bonus Enhancements (Optional)

* Add blur or glow to the central object using `filter: blur(1px)` or `box-shadow`
* Use a lightweight animated SVG or 3D model in place of a static image
* Integrate a smooth scroll-down indicator (e.g., a bouncing arrow)

Let me know if you want this built into HTML/CSS/JS files for direct use in Replit. I can also help you integrate frameworks like GSAP or Three.js if you want more advanced visuals!
